Code4lib Anti-Harassment Policy
===============================

This is repository is a space for dialog in the maintenance of an anti-harassment policy for the [Code4lib](http://code4lib.org/) annual conference, mailing list, and other Code4Lib channels.

Resources for policies/starting points:

* [The Ada Initiative: Anti-harassment work](http://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/conference-policies/)
* [Geek Feminism Wiki: example anti-harassment policy for conferences](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy)
* [how to hack code4lib: don't be sexist/racist/*ist](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/How_to_hack_code4lib#Don.27t_be_sexist.2Fracist.2F.2Aist)
* [MoreThanMen.org Harassment policy examples for conferences ](http://www.morethanmen.org/harassment-policies/)
* [CAUT Anti-harassment and Non-Discrimination Statement](http://www.caut.ca/about-us/caut-policy/lists/administrative-procedures-and-guidelines/caut-anti-harassment-statement)
* [AAI Anti-harassment policy](http://www.atheistalliance.org/activities/23-conventions/507-anti-harassment-policy): This is a good one because it includes a short boilerplate statement for conferences/events, plus a longer document suitable for the organization as a whole.

## Code of Code4Lib Conduct

The [Code of Code4Lib Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) is an evolving document that applies not only to the annual Code4Lib conference, but also to the other ways we interact, including the[Code4lib listserv](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CODE4LIB), [irc](https://code4lib.org/irc/), and other Code4Lib venues, such as the Slack and Discord channels.

As we learn and grow, we welcome suggestions for changes. You can [follow our change procedures](https://github.com/code4lib/code-of-conduct/blob/main/how_changes_are_made.md) to make suggestions in one of the following ways:
